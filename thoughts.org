  I like how the program is developing.
  The ecs system is still weird to work with but thinking about it as a pipeline with partial computation is helpful.
  I am still trying to think about when do I make something is own entity and when do handle dependencies between entities.
  I think the next thing to do is make some sort of collision system so that I can start making things interact.
  Currently path following dose a ruff sort of collision handling but I think it would be worth bulling out on its own.
  I think I will have collision store a vec of all the things it collided with.
  I will have to spend some time thinking about how call backs work and also how I clear the coalition information. 
  Also it is probably worth splitting things out into ones that can give collisions and those that can reserve.

  Ok I really like that I have a path finding algorithm and some Tiles showing.
  I need to spend some time thinking about how I will handle my transforms and dependencies with regard to that.
  
  I considered having one master object that stores the main transform and have everything be a child of that.
  However I don't really like that as it would make generating entities complicated.
  Alternatively I am considering making a function of ground that will spit out the a *new "default"* based of the ground layout.
  I like this Idea however I would need to be a bit careful about making sure I always use it rather then default.
  Additionally there is a concept of a size witch I might be able to explore in order for scaling to work handle this.
** Learn about how scale is dealt with.
*** DONE reset the tile sheet to use a scale of 1 and centered at default.

*** DONE change the camera layout so that the screen is filled properly.
    CLOSED: [2021-05-08 Sat 14:15]
*** DONE find out where/how negative numbers are mapped in the tile map.
    CLOSED: [2021-05-08 Sat 14:15]
    This will be important for when I need to index into ground and will determine how I need to think about the transforms
*** DONE scale entities that are created and get the back on the screen ( indexing my not be correct yet).

** implement transform management system.
*** TODO Create/load in spites that are the appropriate size.
*** DONE Modify ground to store the size of a tile.

*** DONE Modify ground so that it creates the map.
    CLOSED: [2021-05-14 Fri 11:56]
*** DONE Modify ground so it returns it returns the transforms of the camera/map.

  Ok I like that the game is going and the code I have made a fair amount of progress fairly quickly. 
** DONE Making the game look better.

*** DONE Add sprite for the ground.
    CLOSED: [2021-05-18 Tue 18:04]
    - [X] Multiple background tiles for the spites.
    - [ ] Add something with trees or what not.
    - [X] possibly create multiple types of background tiles in the map.
*** DONE Make a sprite for the bullets

** DONE Make the game more playable

     - use vim bindings for control.
     - move with unit size rather then anything else.
*** TODO Make a way of editing layers/save layers.
** Redactor code to make it more readable.
*** DONE Move tower to its own mod with system in side in separate files.

** TODO re-factor enemy into sub mods. 
** TODO split Tower placement into two separate systems
*** One for tracking mouse position.
    Define a type and use a reasorce.
*** One for placement 
** TODO create an editing state.
** TODO implement some normal features.
   - [ ] a money system.
   - [ ] towers can only be placed on open tiles.
   - [ ] health/life (it might be interesting if these were the same value, the more you spend the easier it is to lose.)
   - [ ] Ranges for towers.
** TODO Create more of a waive system.
